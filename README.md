## Hi! I'm Adrian

### Who am I?

I am a veteran of the United States Marine Corps. From working on artillery to writing code,
it's been an incredible journey. My amazing experiences in the Marine Corps helped shape who I am,
and began to develop attributes necessary to be a developer. It's been a long journey. My military
skills took me first to a career in security, where I helped maintain a SQL database for card access systems.
In 2017 I started taking classes to pursue a career as a database administrator but it wasn't until I took a
javascript class that I realized where my future lies.

I found [Vets Who Code](https://vetswhocode.io/) through a mention on Twitter, and after doing some research,
sent in an application. Through this organization, I have learned more than I had previously thought possible,
and now, I'm part of the Codepen team.

### Android Development

I started coding to build custom Android ROMs. I started small, learning to manipulate XML to make themes.
Soon, I found myself manipulating system images and creating automated build scripts. Ever more curious, I dove into Java.
I loved how I could manipulate code into a feature in the Android system! One of the co-founders of a developer team,
we released our own Android ROM, called _[UnholyDevs](https://youtu.be/gOjHiOEFCxg)_. This was the launchpad for a career in coding.
