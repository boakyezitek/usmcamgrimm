### Towed Artillery to Front-End Developer

I am a veteran of the United States Marine Corps. From working on artillery to writing code, it's been an amazing journey. Initially I sought a career in database management and was studying SQL, MSSQL Server administration, and Oracle Database. I found [Vets Who Code](https://vetswhocode.io/), and through this organization, I have learned more than I had previously thought possible. Now, I'm part of the Codepen team.  Concentrating on front-end, I use the tools I've learned to build cool stuff for others.

### Android Development

I loved how I could manipulate code into a feature in the Android system! This was the launchpad for my career in coding. I've built custom frameworks, themes, and kernels. I enjoy designing graphics as well, and manipulating images for use as wallpapers and backgrounds.
